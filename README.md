### Wildlife habitat suitability models based on LANDIS-II Model in 4FRI Region of Northern Arizona


The purpose of this repository is to create a model that will collect the outputs from the already created 'LANDIS-II' model, and use those parameters to determine the quality of habitat for a number of important wildlife species present in Northern Arizona forests into the future. 

#### 4FRI 
The study area is focused on the '4FRI' region (4 Forest Restoration Initiative), which is a grouping of the Kaibab, Coconino, Apache-Sitgreaves, and Tonto National Forests in Northern Arizona. Throughout these forests, management objectives are focused on restoring healthy forest structures in fire-adapted ecosystems. This comes through reducing fuel loads and establishing structual diversity to help mitigate the risk of large-scale wildfires in this region. Read more here: https://www.fs.usda.gov/4fri 

#### LANDIS-II MODEL
The LANDIS-II Model is a free and open-source landscape-scale forecasting model that is used to understand potential future trends in forest ecosystem structure across large areas and many years into the future. The model has been applied throughout the world and is quite versitile with its ability to adapt to changes in management, disturbances, or land use changes.

In an attempt to understand future carbon dynamics with restoration objectives, the LANDIS-II model has recently been applied to the 4FRI region and was published by McCauley et al., 2019.

#### Wildlife habitat suitability models
The forecasting ability and versatility of the LANDIS-II Model have made it possible to use the outputs generated by the model, and predict what the habitat quality will be for a number of important wildlife species throughout Northern Arizona. For the purposes of our study, we will be looking at Mexican Spotted Owl, Mule Deer, Abert's Squirrel, several important songbirds, macroinvertebrates, and small mammal species. Using available information from literature and potential datasources, we will establish the characteristics necessary for ideal habitat for each species (or species groups) based on the outputs of the LANDIS-II model. From this, we can understand the potential effects of forest restoration on habitat quality into the future. With these model predictions, we can help managers create informed and appropriate decisions now, with the combined goal of restoring forests while also promoting the conservation of important wildlife.
