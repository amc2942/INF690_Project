### Wildlife habitat suitability models based on LANDIS-II Model in 4FRI Region of Northern Arizona


The purpose of this repository is to create a model that will collect the outputs from the already created 'LANDIS-II' model, and use those parameters to determine the quality of habitat for a number of important wildlife species present in Northern Arizona forests. 

#### 4FRI 
The study area is focused on the '4FRI' region (4 Forest Restoration Initiative), which is a grouping of the Kaibab, Coconino, Apache-Sitgreaves, and Tonto National Forests in Northern Arizona. Throughout these forests, management objectives are focused on restoring healthy forest structures in fire-adapted ecosystems. This comes through reducing fuel loads and establishing structual diversity to help mitigate the risk of large-scale wildfires in this region. Read more here: https://www.fs.usda.gov/4fri 

#### LANDIS-II MODEL
The LANDIS-II Model is a free and open-source landscape-scale forecasting model that is used to understand potential future trends in forest ecosystem structure across large areas. The model has been applied throughout the world and is quite versitile with its ability to adapt to changes in management, disturbances, or land use changes.
